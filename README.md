# Media Sharing Platform

## Architecture

Client-server architecture, architecture of a computer network in which many clients (remote processors) request and receive service from a centralized server (host computer).

## Technology Stack

### Client Side
- React
- React Hooks
- Bootstrap
- Primereact
- Axios
- @tanstack/react-query

### Server Side
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Sequelize (ORM for interacting with the database)
- MySQL (Database)
- Multer (File handler)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash

3. **Open 2 command prompts.**

4. **With one prompt: Navigate to the server directory:**

   ```bash
   cd server

5. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install

6. **Start the server:**

The server should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

7. **With the other prompt: Navigate to the client directory:**

   cd client

8. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install

9. **Start the client:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev

The client should now be running on http://localhost:5173.

10. **Open a browser tab and copy the client link.**

11. **Voila!!**

**P.S.:** It's responsive on all platforms.
